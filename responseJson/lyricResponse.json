    "lyric": "Is this the real life?\nIs this just fantasy?\nCaught in a landslide\nNo escape from reality\n\nOpen your eyes\nLook up to the skies and see\nI'm just a poor boy\nI need no sympathy\nBecause I'm easy come, easy go\nLittle high, little low\nAnyway the wind blows\nDoesn't really matter to me\nTo me\n\nMama, just killed a man\nPut a gun against his head\nPulled my trigger, now he's dead\nMama, life had just begun\nBut now I've gone and thrown it all away\n\nMama! Ooh!\nDidn't mean to make you cry\nIf I'm not back again this time tomorrow\nCarry on, carry on\nAs if nothing really matters\n\nToo late, my time has come\nSends shivers down my spine\nBody's aching all the time\nGoodbye, everybody\nI've got to go\nGotta leave you all behind\nAnd face the truth\n\nMama! Ooh!\n(Anyway the wind blows)\nI don't wanna die\nI sometimes wish I'd never been born at all\n\nI see a little silhouetto of a man\nScaramouche! Scaramouche!\nWill you do the fandango?\nThunderbolt and lightning\nVery, very frightening me!\nGalileo! Galileo!\nGalileo! Galileo!\nGalileo, Figaro!\nMagnifico!\n\nI'm just a poor boy and nobody loves me\n(He's just a poor boy from a poor family)\n(Spare him his life, from this monstrosity)\n\nEasy come, easy go\nWill you let me go?\n\nBismillah!\nNo, we will not let you go!\n(Let him go!)\nBismillah!\nWe will not let you go!\n(Let him go!)\nBismillah!\nWe will not let you go!\n(Let me go!)\nWill not let you go!\n(Let me go!)\nNever, never let you go!\nNever, never, never let me go!\nNo, no, no, no, no, no, no!\n\nOh, mamma mia, mamma mia!\nMamma mia, let me go!\nBeelzebub has a devil put aside for me!\nFor me!\nFor me!\n\nSo you think you can stone me and spit in my eye?\nSo you think you can love me and leave me to die?\nOh, baby!\nCan't do this to me, baby!\nJust gotta get out\nJust gotta get right outta here!\n\nOh, yeah!\nOh, yeah!\n\nNothing really matters\nAnyone can see\nNothing really matters\nNothing really matters to me\n\nAnyway the wind blows"
